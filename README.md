## Prerequisites

The following kernel modules are incompatible with this driver and should not be loaded:
* ssb
* bcma
* b43
* brcmsmac

Make sure to unload (`rmmod` command) and blacklist those modules in order to prevent them from being automatically
reloaded during the next system startup:

`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`
```
# wireless drivers (conflict with Broadcom hybrid wireless driver 'wl')
blacklist ssb
blacklist bcma
blacklist b43
blacklist brcmsmac
```

## Compile and install

### Manually

Build and install for the running kernel:

```sh
$ make
$ make install
$ depmod -A
$ modprobe wl
```

### Automatically

Using [DKMS][2] and the included `dkms.conf` file, one can let the operating system rebuild and install the module
automatically on every new kernel installation:

```sh
$ dkms add /path/to/this/repo
$ dkms status
broadcom-wl, 6.30.223.271: added
```

Providing that the `dkms` service is enabled, the module should appear as *installed* in the list of modules managed by
DKMS after the system boots for the first time on the new kernel:

```sh
$ dkms status
broadcom-wl, 6.30.223.271, 4.7.6-200.x86_64, x86_64: installed
```
